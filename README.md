# 📊 EDA: AI Assistant Usage in Student Life

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Kaggle dataset **"AI Assistant Usage in Student Life"**, which simulates 10,000 student sessions using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) across various disciplines and academic levels.

> ✅ Project focus: How students use AI tools for writing, coding, studying, brainstorming, and more — and how their satisfaction, session time, and disciplines vary.

## 🔎 Analysis Highlights

### 1. AI Usage by Education Level
- 🏆 Undergraduates are the top users (5,978 sessions), followed by High School and Graduate students.
- **Insight**: Undergraduate students are the most active adopters of AI tools in learning activities.

### 2. Most Common Task Types
- ✍️ Writing and 💻 Coding are the most frequent AI tasks.
- **Insight**: Students rely heavily on AI for content generation and code support.

### 3. Satisfaction Rating by Task
- Highest: Brainstorming & Writing tasks (avg > 4.0)
- Lowest: Coding
- **Insight**: AI tools are better received when helping structure ideas, but less effective in technical tasks.

### 4. Usage by Discipline
- Most sessions from Biology, Computer Science, and Engineering students.
- **Insight**: STEM fields lead in usage, but AI is used across all disciplines.

### 5. Average Session Duration
- Longest: Coding (~17 min), Writing (~15 min)
- Shortest: Brainstorming (~9 min)
- **Insight**: Technical tasks lead to longer AI engagement.
